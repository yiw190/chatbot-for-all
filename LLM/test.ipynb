    "Treatment\n",
    "Post-traumatic stress disorder treatment can help you regain a sense of control over your life. The primary treatment is psychotherapy, but can also include medication. Combining these treatments can help improve your symptoms by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Teaching you skills to address your symptoms\n",
    "Helping you think better about yourself, others, and the world\n",
    "Learning ways to cope if any symptoms arise again\n",
    "Treating other problems often related to traumatic experiences, such as depression, anxiety, or misuse of alcohol or drugs\n",
    "You don't have to try to handle the burden of PTSD on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychotherapy\n",
    "Several types of psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, may be used to treat children and adults with PTSD. Some types of psychotherapy used in PTSD treatment include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive therapy. This type of talk therapy helps you recognize the ways of thinking (cognitive patterns) that are keeping you stuck — for example, negative beliefs about yourself and the risk of traumatic things happening again. For PTSD, cognitive therapy often is used along with exposure therapy.\n",
    "Exposure therapy. This behavioral therapy helps you safely face both situations and memories that you find frightening so that you can learn to cope with them effectively. Exposure therapy can be particularly helpful for flashbacks and nightmares. One approach uses virtual reality programs that allow you to re-enter the setting in which you experienced trauma.\n",
    "Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR combines exposure therapy with a series of guided eye movements that help you process traumatic memories and change how you react to them.\n",
    "Your therapist can help you develop stress management skills to help you better handle stressful situations and cope with stress in your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these approaches can help you gain control of lasting fear after a traumatic event. You and your mental health professional can discuss what type of therapy or combination of therapies may best meet your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may try individual therapy, group therapy, or both. Group therapy can offer a way to connect with others going through similar experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medications\n",
    "Several types of medications can help improve symptoms of PTSD:\n",
    "\n",
    "Antidepressants. These medications can help symptoms of depression and anxiety. They can also help improve sleep problems and concentration. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PTSD treatment.\n",
    "Anti-anxiety medications. These drugs can relieve severe anxiety and related problems. Some anti-anxiety medications have the potential for abuse, so they are generally used only for a short time.\n",
    "Prazosin. While several studies indicated that prazosin (Minipress) may reduce or suppress nightmares in some people with PTSD, a more recent study showed no benefit over placebo. But participants in the recent study differed from others in ways that potentially could impact the results. Individuals who are considering prazosin should speak with a doctor to determine whether or not their particular situation might merit a trial of this drug.\n",
    "You and your doctor can work together to figure out the best medication, with the fewest side effects, for your symptoms and situation. You may see an improvement in your mood and other symptoms within a few weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell your doctor about any side effects or problems with medications. You may need to try more than one or a combination of medications, or your doctor may need to adjust your dosage or medication schedule before finding the right fit for you.\n",
